/*JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
JSON is a lightweight data interchange format.jSON is a format for storing and transporting data.
JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.
When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text.
JSON is text, and we can convert any JavaScript object into JSON, and send JSON to the server.
We can also convert any JSON received from the server into JavaScript objects.
This way we can work with the data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations.*/
