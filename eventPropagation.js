//A click on an image does not only generate a click event for the corresponding IMG element, but also for the parent A,
for the grandfather LI and so on, going all the way up through all the elementâ€™s ancestors, before terminating at the window object.

//From the window to the event target parent: this is the capture phase
//The event target itself: this is the target phase
//From the event target parent back to the window: the bubble phase.
